name: Remote Access Servers
overview: |
    The organization classifies remote access servers as
    _jump hosts_ or _bastion hosts_. The organization recognizes the
    following definitions when necessary to distinguish between
    the two classes of remote access server.

    Jump host
      ~ Allows access between _internal_ domains with different trust levels.

      ~ For example, the organization uses jump hosts to restrict
        access between corporate desktop environments and server environments
        within organization datacenters.

    Bastion host
      ~ Allows access into corporate environments from _external_ domains.

      ~ For example, the organization uses bastion hosts to restrict
        access from the public Internet.

    Here is a high-level diagram of the remote access system.
